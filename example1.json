{'ans': ' OpenVINO is an open-source software toolkit designed to optimize, '
        'accelerate, and deploy deep learning models for various applications. '
        'It is developed by Intel and supports a wide range of Intel hardware '
        'platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. The toolkit streamlines '
        'the deployment of deep learning models in user applications, '
        'optimizing and accelerating model inference for domains like '
        'Generative AI, Large Language models, and use cases such as object '
        'detection, classification, and segmentation.',
